                <strong>The Evolution of Personal Computers</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                The concept of a personal computer has dramatically transformed
                since its inception. In the early days, computers like the Apple
                II in the 1980s defined what a personal computer could be. They
                were large, often required a significant amount of space, and
                were not accessible to most due to high costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fast forward to today, personal computers are not only
                accessible but have become an integral part of our daily lives.
                They come in various forms, from powerful desktops to portable
                laptops, catering to a wide range of functions from professional
                work, gaming, to general entertainment.

              </h3>
              <p>
                The motherboard is the heart of the computer, housing the CPU,
                memory, and essential controllers. It also provides connectors
                for other peripherals like storage devices, graphics cards, and
                external devices. The design and functionality of the
                motherboard determine the compatibility and expandability of the
                computer system.

              <p>
                Motherboards come in various form factors, which dictate the
                size of the board and the placement of its components:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong style={{ color: "white" }}>ATX:</strong> Full-sized
                  boards offering maximum expandability with more slots for
                  memory, graphics cards, and other peripherals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong style={{ color: "white" }}>Micro-ATX:</strong> Smaller
                  than ATX but still offers sufficient expandability for most
                  users.

                <li>
                  <strong style={{ color: "white" }}>Mini-ITX:</strong> Very
                  compact motherboards used in small form-factor PCs and home
                  theater systems. Limited expandability but excellent for
                  builds with smaller footprints.

                  5. The Importance of the Motherboard in System Performance
                </strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                While the CPU is often seen as the "brain" of the computer, the
                motherboard could be thought of as the "central nervous system,"
                integral to the overall performance and efficiency of the
                computer. It impacts everything from the boot-up process and
                loading applications to gaming performance and multi-tasking
                ability.
