              </h3>
              <p>
                Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a critical component of
                an organization's security framework. Effective IAM ensures that
                only authorized users have access to the resources they need
                while protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
                Implementing best practices in IAM helps organizations mitigate
                risks, ensure compliance, and enhance operational efficiency.
                This document outlines key best practices for IAM to help
                organizations establish a robust and secure IAM strategy.

                <strong>1. Principle of Least Privilege</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                The principle of least privilege (PoLP) dictates that users and
                systems should have the minimum level of access necessary to
                perform their functions. This reduces the risk of accidental or
                malicious misuse of access.
