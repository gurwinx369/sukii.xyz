                clients. This company manages a vast array of risks, from
                cybersecurity threats to financial risks, and needs a robust
                risk management strategy.

              </h4>
              <p>
                For its contracts with U.S. federal agencies, the company adopts
                NIST RMF to manage the risks associated with its information
                systems. This ensures that they meet all federal compliance
                requirements and maintain a strong security posture.
              </p>

              <h4 style={{ color: "white" }}>
                <strong>Application of ISO 31000</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                For its global operations, the company implements ISO 31000 to
                manage a broader range of risks, including operational,
                financial, and reputational risks. This allows the company to
                have a unified risk management strategy that aligns with its
                business objectives across different regions and industries.
              </p>

                <strong>Integrated Approach</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                By integrating both NIST RMF and ISO 31000, the company achieves
                comprehensive risk management, ensuring robust cybersecurity
                while also addressing other critical risks that could impact its
                business operations globally.
              </p>

              <p>
                In conclusion, both NIST RMF and ISO 31000 offer valuable
                frameworks for managing risks, each with its strengths and
                specific applications. Understanding the differences and
                appropriate contexts for these frameworks is crucial for
                organizations aiming to implement an effective risk management
                strategy.

                Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of policies

                right resources at the right times for the right reasons.
                Effective IAM is critical for ensuring security and compliance

                Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a
                user to access multiple applications with one set of login
                credentials. SSO improves user experience by reducing the number
                of times users need to log in and enhances security by
                centralizing authentication.

                Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that

                gain access to a resource. MFA adds an additional layer of
                security by combining something the user knows (password) with
                something the user has (smartphone, security token) or something
                the user is (biometric verification).
