                Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and its successor, Transport Layer
                Security (TLS), are cryptographic protocols designed to provide
                secure communication over a computer network. These protocols
                are primarily used to secure web traffic, ensuring that data
                transferred between a user's browser and a web server remains
                private and unaltered.

                  HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the
                  implementation of HTTP over SSL/TLS. When you visit a website
                  that uses HTTPS, your connection is encrypted using SSL/TLS,
                  providing a secure browsing experience. HTTPS is crucial for
                  protecting sensitive information such as login credentials,
                  personal data, and payment information from being intercepted
                  by malicious actors.
